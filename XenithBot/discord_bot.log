They tell me, "Keep it simple, " I tell them, "Take it slow"
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them, "Take it easy, " they laugh and tell me, "No"
It's cool, but I don't see them laughin' at my money, though
They spittin' facts at me, I'm spittin' tracks, catch me?
I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can't combat me
They tell me, "Jesus walks, " I tell them, "Money talks"
Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an icebox
They tell me I've been sleepin', I say, "I'm wide awake"
Tracks hot and ready, so they call me Mr. Easy-Bake
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank
Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different, but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me, and I'm laughin' at the pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"
They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the façade
Six feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together, but I would be lost without their love
Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think, and I don't do pain

—Java language creator James Gosling
When the Java programming language was unleashed on the public in 1995, it
was an inventive toy for the Web that had the potential to be more.
The word “potential” is a compliment that comes with an expiration date. Sooner
or later, potential must be realized, or new words and phrases are used in its
place, such as “slacker,” “letdown,” “waste,” or “major disappointment to your
mother and me.”
As you develop your skills in this book’s 21 one-day tutorials, you’ll be in a
good position to judge whether the language has lived up to more than a decade
of hype.
You’ll also become a Java programmer with a lot of potential.' (descifrador93 chatroom - Gemini Pro) [model：gemini-pro]

Now in its ninth major release, Java has lived up to the expectations that
accompanied its arrival. More than four million programmers have learned the
language and are using it in places such as NASA, IBM, Kaiser Permanente, and
Google. It’s a standard part of the academic curriculum at many computer
science departments around the world. First used to create simple programs on
web pages, Java can be found today in the following places (and many more):
Web servers
Relational databases
Orbiting telescopes
E-book readers
Cell phones

The story of the Java language is well known by this point. James Gosling and a
team of developers were working on an interactive TV project at Sun
Microsystems in the mid-1990s when Gosling became frustrated with the
language being used. C++ was an object-oriented programming language
developed a decade earlier as an extension of the C language.
To address some of the things that frustrated him about C++, Gosling holed up
in his office and created a new language that was suitable for his project.
Although that interactive TV effort flopped, Gosling’s language had unforeseen
applicability to a new medium that was becoming popular at the same time: the
Web.
Java was released to the public for the first time in 1995. Although most of the
language’s features were primitive compared with C++ (and Java today), special
Java programs called applets could be run as part of web pages on the most
popular web browser at that time, Netscape Navigator.
This functionality—the first interactive programming available on the Web—
drew so much attention to the new language that several hundred thousand
programmers learned Java in its first six months.
Even after the novelty of Java web programming wore off, the overall benefits of
the language became clear, and the programmers stuck around. There are more
professional Java programmers today than C++ programmers.
Sun Microsystems controlled the development of the Java language from its
inception until 2010, when the company was acquired by the database and
enterprise software giant Oracle in a $7.4 billion deal. Oracle, a longtime user of
the language on its own products, has a strong commitment to supporting Java
and continues to increase its capabilities with each new release.' (descifrador93 chatroom - Gemini Pro) [model：gemini-pro]

Java is an object-oriented, platform-neutral, secure language designed to be
easier to learn than C++ and harder to misuse than C and C++.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software development methodology in
which a program is conceptualized as a group of objects that work together.
Objects are created from templates called classes, and they contain data and the
statements required to use that data. Java is primarily object-oriented, as you’ll
see later today when you create your first class and use it to create objects.
Platform neutrality is a program’s ability to run without modification in different
computing environments. Java programs are transformed into a format called
bytecode that can be run by any computer or device equipped with a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM). You can create a Java program on a Windows 10 machine that
runs on a Linux web server, an Apple Mac using OS 10.10, and a Samsung
Android phone. As long as a platform has a JVM, it can run the bytecode.
Although the relative ease of learning one language over another is always a
point of contention among programmers, Java was designed to be easier than
C++ primarily in the following ways:
Java automatically takes care of memory allocation and deallocation,
freeing programmers from this error-prone and complex task.
Java doesn’t include pointers, a powerful feature for experienced
programmers that can be easily misused and introduce major security
vulnerabilities.
Java includes only single inheritance in object-oriented programming.
The lack of pointers and the presence of automatic memory management are two
key elements of Java security.' (descifrador93 chatroom - Gemini Pro) [model：gemini-pro]

Now that you’ve been introduced to Java as a spectator, it’s time to put some of
these concepts into play and create your first Java program.
If you work your way through the 21 days of this book, you’ll become well
versed in Java’s capabilities, including graphics, file input and output, XML
processing, and Android app development. You will write programs that run on
web pages and others that run on your computer, web servers, or other
computing environments.
Before you get started, you must have software on your computer that can be
used to edit, prepare, and run Java programs that use the most up-to-date version
of the language: Java 8.
Several popular integrated development environments (IDEs) for Java support
version 8, including IntelliJ IDEA and the open source software Eclipse.
If you are learning to use these tools at the same time as you are learning Java, it
can be a daunting task. Most IDEs are aimed primarily at experienced
programmers who want to be more productive, not new people who are taking
their first foray into a new language.
The simplest tool for Java development is the Java Development Kit, which is
free and can be downloaded from
www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads.

Whenever Oracle releases a new version of Java, it also makes a free
development kit available over the Web to support that version. The current
release is Java SE Development Kit 8.
The drawback of developing Java programs with the JDK is that it is a set of
command-line tools. Therefore, it has no graphical user interface for editing
programs, turning them into Java classes, and testing them. (A command line is
simply a prompt for typing text commands. It’s available in Windows as the
program Command Prompt.)' (descifrador93 chatroom - Gemini Pro) [model：gemini-pro]
